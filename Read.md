Introduction: Personal vehicles are a major factor in causing climate change. I want to find out which factors in a car contribute the most pollution. My project will be to analyze the "CO2 Emission by Vehicles" dataset that I found on Kaggle published by Debajyoti Podder.

Dataset: CO2 Emissions_Canada.csv
My Final Project: CarProject.Rmd


Understanding the Data:
Model,4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
,AWD = All-wheel drive
,FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
,SWB = Short wheelbase
,LWB = Long wheelbase
,EWB = Extended wheelbase
Transmission,A = automatic
,AM = automated manual
,AS = automatic with select shift
,AV = continuously variable
,M = manual
,3 - 10 = Number of gears
Fuel type,X = regular gasoline
,Z = premium gasoline
,D = diesel
,E = ethanol (E85)
,N = natural gas
